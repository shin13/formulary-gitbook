OCIA,Tadalafil,Cialis 20mg 4's/box,SGU,,Erectile dysfunction,,RT,"Erectile dysfunction a) ONCE-DAILY DOSING 1) Once-daily doses of 50 milligrams (mg) have been effective in nondiabetic patients with mild or moderate erectile dysfunction; doses were taken each morning (Porst, 2002b). The longest duration of once-daily treatment has been 3 weeks. 2) This dose regimen provides ""round-the-clock coverage,"" eliminating the need for planning of sexual activity and enhancing spontaneity; however, it has not been evaluated as extensively as on-demand dosing. b) ON-DEMAND DOSING 1) For on-demand dosing, the manufacturer recommends an initial dose of 10 milligrams (mg) prior to sexual activity. The dose may be increased to 20 mg or decreased to 5 mg depending upon individual efficacy and tolerability. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once daily. Tadalafil has been shown to improve erectile function for up to 36 hours after administration. Tadalafil may be taken with or without food (Prod Info Cialis(R), 2003n). 2) In patients taking concomitant potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, ritonavir), the maximum recommended dose of tadalafil is 10 milligrams, not to exceed once every 72 hours (Prod Info Cialis(R), 2003n). 3) Studies indicate that doses of 10 to 25 milligrams are effective in mild-to-severe erectile dysfunction, including diabetics (Anon, 2001a; Porst, 2002b; Padma-Nathan et al, 2001b; Sorbera et al, 2001b; Saenz de Tejada et al, 2001a). 4) Successful erections upon sexual stimulation have been achieved as early as 15 minutes postdosing (Anon, 2001a; Brock, 2001a); most responding patients will achieve an adequate erection within 30 to 45 minutes (Brock, 2001a). Thus, administration 30 to 60 minutes prior to sexual activity would appear sufficient. The duration of effect is up to 36 hours (Porst et al, 2003; Brock, 2001a; Porst, 2002b; Anon, 2001a) and only one dose per 24 hours (as needed) is indicated (Padma-Nathan et al, 2001b).

Serum total testosterone concentrations should be checked periodically. The following rules should be applied: 1.

A single 100-microgram dose is recommended in women who weigh less than or equal to 60 kilograms and who are 36 years of age or younger. A single 150-microgram dose is recommended in women: who weigh more than 60 kilograms, regardless of age; who weigh 50 kilograms or more and who are older than 36 years of age. Women older than 36 years of age who weighed less than 50 kilograms were not studied. The recommended doses of Elonva have only been established in a treatment cycle with a GnRH antagonist that was administered from stimulation day 5 or day 6 onwards. Stimulation day 1: Elonva should be administered as a single subcutaneous injection, preferably in the abdominal wall, during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Stimulation day 5 or 6: Treatment with a Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) antagonist should be started on stimulation day 5 or day 6 depending on the ovarian response, i.e. the number and size of growing follicles. The concurrent determination of serum estradiol levels may also be useful. The GnRH antagonist is used to prevent premature Luteinizing Hormone (LH) surges. Stimulation day 8: Seven days after the injection with Elonva on stimulation day 1, COS treatment may be continued with daily injections of (recombinant) Follicle Stimulating Hormone ((rec)FSH) until the criterion for triggering final oocyte maturation (3 follicles > or = 17 mm) has been reached. The daily dose of (rec)FSH may depend on the ovarian response, which should be monitored by regular ultrasonographic assessments from stimulation day 5 or 6 onwards. In normal responders a daily dose of 150 IU (rec)FSH is advised. Administration of (rec)FSH on the day of human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) administration can be omitted, depending on the ovarian response. In general, adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the ninth day of treatment (range 6 to 18 days). As soon as three follicles > or = 17 mm are observed, a single injection of 5,000 up to 10,000 IU urinary hCG is administered the same day or the day thereafter to induce final oocyte maturation. In case of an excessive ovarian response, see the recommendations given in Precautions in order to reduce the risk for developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).",µL»Ý½Õ¾ã¾¯¶q,,µL»Ý½Õ¾ã¾¯¶q,¨S¦³¸ê®Æ,Uknown ¨S¦³¸ê®Æ,"[¥é³æ]Elonva¤£¥i¨Ï¥Î©óÃh¥¥°ü¤k¡C ­Y¦bÃh¥¥´Á¶¡¤£¤p¤ß±µÄ²¨ìElonva®É,²{¦³ªºÁ{§É¸ê®Æ¨Ã¤£¨¬¥H±Æ°£µo¥ÍÃh¥¥¤£¨}µ²ªGªº¥i¯à©Ê¡C ¦b°Êª«¬ã¨s¤¤´¿Æ[¹î¨ì¥X²{¥Í´Þ¨t²Î¬r©Êªº²{¶H",Unknown ¨S¦³¸ê®Æ,[¥é³æ]¦bÁý­÷¥À¨Å´Á¶¡¤£¾A¦X¨Ï¥ÎElonva¡C,SC;,,,,,"½Ð¶J¦s©ó¦B½c¤¤(2¢XC-8¢XC)¡C¬°¤è«K¨Ï¥Î°_¨£,¯f¤H¥i±N¥»«~¦s©ñ25¢XC©Î(§t)¥H¤Uªº·Å«×,¦ý¤£¥i¶W¹L1­Ó¤ë¡C ¤Á¤Å§N­á¡C"
