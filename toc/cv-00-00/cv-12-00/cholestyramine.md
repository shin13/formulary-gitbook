| Contraindications  | Cholestyramine Resin should not be used by patients who are allergic to any of its ingredients or by patients with complete biliary obstruction, as bile cannot enter the intestine and the drug will not be effective. This product contains Aspartame as an excipient, so it should not be used by patients with phenylketonuria (phenylketonurics).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
