| Indications        | 1. Monotherapy for localized seizures with or without secondary generalized seizures in patients aged four and above who have experienced either their first or multiple seizures. 2. Adjunctive therapy for the following conditions: (1) Patients aged four and above with complex partial seizures and simple or complex partial seizures with secondary generalization, with or without other seizure types. (2) Patients aged four and above with primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS) and idiopathic generalized epilepsy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Dosing             | Children and adolescents bodyweight >=50 kg and adults: Monotherapy and Adjunctive Therapy: Initial Dosage: 50 mg twice daily. One week later, the initial therapeutic dose was increased to 100 mg twice a day. According to response and tolerability, the maintenance dose can be increased by 50 mg twice a day (100 mg/day) per week, to the maximum recommended daily dose: 200 mg twice a day. Start treatment with a fast-acting dose of Lacosamide:200 mg as a single dose. After 12 hours,100 mg twice a day (200 mg/day) as a maintenance dose. Discontinue the drug: recommended to gradually reduce the dose (for example, reduce the daily dose by 200 mg/week). For patients with severe cardiac arrhythmia, clinical benefit/risk assessment should be performed, and Lacosamide should be discontinued if necessary. Switch from a single antiepileptic drug (AED) to Lacosamide monotherapy: The anti-epileptic drugs should not be discontinued until the therapeutic dose of Lacosamide is reached for at least 3 days. It is recommended to gradually stop using anti-epileptic drugs for at least 6 weeks. |
