| Contraindications  | Individuals who have had a severe allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine, or who have previously experienced a severe allergic reaction after receiving this vaccine or a vaccine containing the same components or composition, should not receive IMOJEV. Those with congenital or acquired immunodeficiency leading to cellular immune deficiency, including those undergoing immunosuppressive therapy (such as chemotherapy or high-dose systemic corticosteroids for 14 days or more), should also not receive IMOJEV. Patients infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), whether symptomatic or asymptomatic but with evidence of immune function impairment, should not be vaccinated with IMOJEV. Breastfeeding women are contraindicated from receiving the IMOJEV vaccine. |
