| Contraindications  | During pregnancy, this medication should only be administered if deemed absolutely necessary for the mother and fetus. Animal studies have not shown any teratogenic effects. However, current research cannot clarify the risks of administering the drug to pregnant women, and it is still unknown whether the active ingredient is excreted in the breast milk of lactating women. |
| Adverse Effects    | Occasionally, mild local discomfort at beginning of treatment which disappears on discontinuation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
