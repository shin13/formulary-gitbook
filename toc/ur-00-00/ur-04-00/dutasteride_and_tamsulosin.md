| Dosing             | The recommended dose of Duodart is 1 capsule daily (0.5 mg / 0.4 mg). Duodart must always be taken with a glass of water, up to 30 minutes after a meal. It must never be taken on an empty stomach. Ideally, it should be taken at the same time of the day (this means with the same meal). The capsules should be swallowed whole and not chewed or opened, as contact with the capsule contents may result in irritation of the oropharyngeal mucosa.                                                         |
