| Indications        | Psoriasis (Ps) (1) Treatment of adult patients (18 years or older) with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. (2) Pediatric Psoriasis: Treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in pediatric and adolescent patients (6 years and older) who are inadequately controlled on or intolerant to phototherapy or other systemic therapies. Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) (1) Treatment of active psoriatic arthritis in patients (6 years and older) who have had an inadequate response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy. It can be used alone or in combination with methotrexate (MTX). (2) Treatment of active psoriatic arthritis in adult patients (18 years and older) who have had an inadequate response to DMARD therapy， to inhibit the progression of structural damage associated with the disease.

(2) have failed or are intolerant to treatment with immunomodulators or corticosteroids， and have not previously received anti-TNFα agents. (3) have failed or are intolerant to one or more anti-TNFα agents. Ulcerative Colitis: treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adult patients who have had an inadequate response to， lost response to， or were intolerant to conventional therapy (e.g， corticosteroids， 6-mercaptopurine， azathioprine)， or a biologic agent (e.g.， a TNF-alpha antagonist or vedolizumab).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Dosing             | [Plaque psoriasis] Adults: (<=100 kg) 45 mg SC initially and 4 weeks later， followed by 45 mg every 12 weeks. (>100 kg) 90 mg SC initially and 4 weeks later， followed by 90 mg every 12 weeks. Pediatric Psoriasis (6 years and older): (<60 kg) 0.75 mg/kg SC at Weeks 0 and 4， then every 12 weeks. (60-100 kg) 45 mg SC at Weeks 0 and 4， then every 12 weeks. (>100 kg) 90 mg SC at Weeks 0 and 4， then every 12 weeks. Consider discontinuation if no therapeutic benefit after 28 weeks of treatment. [Psoriatic Arthritis] Adults: 45 m SC initially， followed by 45 mg 4 weeks later， then 45 mg every 12 weeks. For patients with co-existent moderate to severe plaque psoriasis weighing >100 kg: 90 mg SC initially， followed by 90 mg 4 weeks later， then 90 mg every 12 weeks. Pediatrics (6-17 years): (<60 kg) 0.75 mg/kg SC at Weeks 0 and 4， followed by the same dose every 12 weeks. (60-100 kg) 45 mg SC at Weeks 0 and 4， followed by the same dose every 12 weeks. (>100 kg with co-existent moderate to severe plaque psoriasis) 90 mg SC at Weeks 0 and 4， followed by the same dose every 12 weeks. [Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis] (>=55 kg) Induction， 260 mg IV over at least 1 hour as a single dose; maintenance， followed 8 weeks later with 90 mg subQ every 8 weeks， followed by 90 mg every 12 weeks. (>55-85 kg) Induction， 390 mg IV over at least 1 hour as a single dose; maintenance， followed 8 weeks later with 90 mg subQ every 8 weeks， followed by 90 mg every 12 weeks. (>85 kg) Induction， 520 mg IV over at least 1 hour as a single dose; maintenance， followed 8 weeks later with 90 mg subQ every 8 weeks， followed by 90 mg every 12 weeks. For patients losing response on 12-week dosing， dose escalation to every 8 weeks may be considered and found beneficial. Based on clinical judgment， patients may subsequently be treated with 90 mg every 8 weeks or 12 weeks. Discontinue therapy if evidence of loss of clinical benefit at 16 weeks following dose escalation or 16 weeks following initiation at the every 8 week dosing. Immunosuppressants and/or corticosteroids may be continued during treatment. Tapering or discontinuation of corticosteroids may be considered in patients who have responded to treatment per standard practice. Resuming therapy with subcutaneous administration every 8 weeks after a treatment interruption is safe and effective. |
