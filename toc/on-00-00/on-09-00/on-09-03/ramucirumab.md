| Indications        | Gastric cancer: (1) Ramucirumab combined with paclitaxel is used for the treatment of advanced or metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma (or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma) that is receiving or receiving chemotherapy with fluoropyrimidine and platinum but the disease has deteriorated. (2) Ramucirumab is used as a single drug for the treatment of advanced or metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma (or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma) that is receiving or has received fluoropyrimidine or platinum chemotherapy but the disease has deteriorated and is not suitable for receiving paclitaxel-containing drugs. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): (1) Ramucirumab and erlotinib are used in the first-line treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. (2) Ramucirumab combined with docetaxel is used to treat locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer that is receiving or receiving platinum-containing chemotherapy but the disease has deteriorated. Colorectal cancer: Ramucirumab and FOLFIRI (irinotecan, folic acid, and 5-fluorouracil) are used for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) that is receiving or receiving bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, and fluoropyrimidine treatment but the disease has deteriorated. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC): Ramucirumab monotherapy is used for hepatocellular carcinoma patients who have received sorafenib treatment and have alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) ?400 ng/mL. |
| Dosing             | Premedicate prior to infusion with an IV H1 antagonist (eg, diphenhydramine); for patients who experienced a grade 1 or 2 infusion reaction with a prior infusion, also premedicate with dexamethasone (or equivalent) and acetaminophen. [Gastric Cancer] 8 mg/kg (either as a single agent or in combination with weekly paclitaxel) every 2 weeks administered by intravenous infusion over 60 minutes. If the first infusion is tolerated, all subsequent infusions may be administered over 30 minutes. Continue CYRAMZA until disease progression orunacceptable toxicity. When given in combination with paclitaxel, administer CYRAMZA prior to administration of paclitaxel. [Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)] - EGFR Exon 19 Deletions or Exon 21 (L858R) Substitution Mutations – CYRAMZA in Combination with Erlotinib: 10 mg/kg infused over 60 minutes every 2 weeks.- Disease Progression On Or After Platinum-based Chemotherapy – CYRAMZA in Combination with Docetaxel: 10 mg/kg infused over 60 minutes on Day 1of a 21-day cycle prior to docetaxel infusion. [Colorectal Cancer] 8 mg/kg infused over 60 minutes every 2 weeks prior to FOLFIRI administration. [Hepatocellular Carcinoma] 8 mg/kg infused over 60 minutes every 2 weeks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
