| Indications        | 1. Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) - PERJETA in combination with Herceptin (trastuzumab) and docetaxel is indicated for the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients who have not previously been treated with anti-HER2 therapy or chemotherapy. 2. Early Breast Cancer (EBC) - PERJETA in combination with Herceptin (trastuzumab) and chemotherapy is indicated for: - Neoadjuvant therapy: For HER2-positive, locally advanced, inflammatory, or early-stage breast cancer (tumor size greater than 2 cm or lymph node-positive) patients as part of the complete treatment regimen for early breast cancer. - Adjuvant therapy: For HER2-positive early breast cancer patients with a high risk of recurrence. - Note: Based on the results of the Aphinity clinical trial, patients with high-risk HER2-positive early breast cancer are defined as those with lymph node-positive disease. |
