| Indications        | For treatment of flat Urothelial Cell Carcinoma in Situ of urinary bladder and as adjunctive therapy following. Transurethral resection of primary or relapsing superficial noninvasive papillary tumors that are limited to the bladder mucosa (stage Ta or T1). Intravesical BCG Immunotherapy has been shown to reduce tumor recurrence and prevent progression.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Dosing             | Treatment should be started 2-3 weeks after performing TURBT(transurethral resection of bladder tumor). The treatment schedule is weekly repeated instillation 120 mg during first 6 weeks， followed by 3 consecutive weekly instillations at 3 months， at 6 months and thereafter every 6 months upto 36 months. This means that a patient who stays tumor free after the initial resection will receive a total of 27 instillations in a period of three years. The duration and frequency of maintenance treatment should be evaluated on the basis of tumor classification and clinical diagnosis.                                                                 |
