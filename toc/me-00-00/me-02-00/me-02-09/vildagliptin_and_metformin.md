| Indications        | Indicated for adults, in conjunction with diet and exercise, to improve blood sugar control in the following patients with type 2 diabetes: those who have already received combination therapy with vildagliptin and metformin, or those using metformin or vildagliptin alone but with inadequate blood sugar control. When diet and exercise along with dual therapy of sulfonylurea and metformin do not provide adequate blood sugar control, Galvus Met can be used in combination with sulfonylurea. When diet and exercise along with a stable dose of insulin and metformin still do not provide adequate blood sugar control, Galvus Met is also suitable for use in combination with insulin. |
