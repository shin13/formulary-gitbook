| Indications        | 1. Type 2 Diabetes - Blood sugar control: In combination with diet and exercise, to improve blood sugar control in adult patients with type 2 diabetes. - Prevention of cardiovascular events: In adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease (CVD) or multiple cardiovascular risk factors, it reduces the risk of heart failure hospitalization. - Prevention of kidney disease: Reduces the risk of new or worsening chronic kidney disease (CKD). 2. Chronic Kidney Disease Used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic kidney disease at risk of worsening, it reduces the risk of persistent decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), heart failure hospitalization, and cardiovascular death. 3. Heart Failure Used in adult patients with heart failure, it reduces the risk of cardiovascular death, heart failure hospitalization, and urgent medical visits for heart failure. |
| Dosing             | Type 2 diabetes initial 5 mg once daily, max 10 mg/day.Heart failure 10 mg once daily.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Contraindications  | Contraindications History of severe allergic reactions to Forxiga, such as hypersensitivity or angioedema. Restrictions - Forxiga is not recommended for use in patients with type 1 diabetes, as it may increase the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis in this group. - Forxiga is not recommended for blood sugar control in patients with type 2 diabetes and an eGFR below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, as Forxiga may be ineffective in this scenario due to its mechanism of action. - Forxiga is not recommended for the treatment of patients with polycystic kidney disease or chronic kidney disease patients who require or have recently received immunosuppressive therapy. Forxiga is expected to be ineffective in these patient populations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
