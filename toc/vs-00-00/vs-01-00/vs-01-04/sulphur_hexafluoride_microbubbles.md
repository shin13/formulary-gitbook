| Indications        | Cardiac Ultrasound: SonoVue is indicated for use in adult patients with suboptimal echocardiographic imaging (where two or more contiguous segments cannot be adequately visualized) to enhance left ventricular cavity opacification and improve endocardial border delineation. Liver Ultrasound: SonoVue is indicated for use in adult patients undergoing liver ultrasound to differentiate focal liver lesions. |
| Dosing             | Cardiovascular imaging: 2 mL IV followed by a 5 mL 0.9%NaCl flush; may administer a second 2 mL IV dose followed by a 5 mL 0.9%NaCl flush during the same imaging session to prolong image enhancement. Hepatic ultrasonography: 2.4 mL IV during the procedure; may administer a second 2.4 mL dose during a single examination, if needed. Follow injection with an IV flush using 5 mL 0.9%NaCl for injection.    |
| Hepatic Impairment | Dose adjustment not necessary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
