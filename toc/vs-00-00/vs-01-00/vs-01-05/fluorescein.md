| Indications        | Diagnostic fluorescein angiography or angioscopy of the fundus & iris vasculature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Dosing             | Use in adults, including the elderly: Inject 5 mL of Fluorescein 10% solution for injection rapidly into the antecubital vein after taking precautions to avoid extravasation. In cases when highly sensitive imaging systems, e.g., scanning laser ophthalmoscope are used, the dose of this product should be reduced to 2 mL of Fluorescein 10% solution for injection. Use in paediatric patients: For children, the dose should be calculated on the basis of 35 mg for each 10 pounds of body weight (7.7 mg/kg body weight). |
