OCIA,Tadalafil,Cialis 20mg 4's/box,SGU,,Erectile dysfunction,,RT,"Erectile dysfunction a) ONCE-DAILY DOSING 1) Once-daily doses of 50 milligrams (mg) have been effective in nondiabetic patients with mild or moderate erectile dysfunction; doses were taken each morning (Porst_ 2002b). The longest duration of once-daily treatment has been 3 weeks. 2) This dose regimen provides ""round-the-clock coverage_"" eliminating the need for planning of sexual activity and enhancing spontaneity; however_ it has not been evaluated as extensively as on-demand dosing. b) ON-DEMAND DOSING 1) For on-demand dosing_ the manufacturer recommends an initial dose of 10 milligrams (mg) prior to sexual activity. The dose may be increased to 20 mg or decreased to 5 mg depending upon individual efficacy and tolerability. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once daily. Tadalafil has been shown to improve erectile function for up to 36 hours after administration. Tadalafil may be taken with or without food (Prod Info Cialis(R)_ 2003n). 2) In patients taking concomitant potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (eg_ ketoconazole_ ritonavir)_ the maximum recommended dose of tadalafil is 10 milligrams_ not to exceed once every 72 hours (Prod Info Cialis(R)_ 2003n). 3) Studies indicate that doses of 10 to 25 milligrams are effective in mild-to-severe erectile dysfunction_ including diabetics (Anon_ 2001a; Porst_ 2002b; Padma-Nathan et al_ 2001b; Sorbera et al_ 2001b; Saenz de Tejada et al_ 2001a). 4) Successful erections upon sexual stimulation have been achieved as early as 15 minutes postdosing (Anon_ 2001a; Brock_ 2001a); most responding patients will achieve an adequate erection within 30 to 45 minutes (Brock_ 2001a). Thus_ administration 30 to 60 minutes prior to sexual activity would appear sufficient. The duration of effect is up to 36 hours (Porst et al_ 2003; Brock_ 2001a; Porst_ 2002b; Anon_ 2001a) and only one dose per 24 hours (as needed) is indicated (Padma-Nathan et al_ 2001b).

Not for intravenous administration Intermittent Peritoneal Dialysis (IPD) For dialysis of acute renal failure patients and maintenance dialysis of chronic renal failure patients_ the cycle of instillation_ dwell and removal of dialysis fluid is repeated sequentially over a period of hours (8 to 36 hours) as many times per week. For chronic renal failure patients who have residual renal function_ maintenance dialysis is often accomplished by periodic dialysis (3 to 5 times weekly) for shorter time periods (8 to 14 hours per session) Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) Patients on CAPD typically perform 4 cycles per day (24 hours). In CAPD_ the solution remains in the cavity for dwell times of 4 to 6 hours during the day and approximately 8 hours overnight. At the conclusion of each dwell period_ the access device is opened_ the solution drained and fresh solution instilled. Automated Peritoneal Dialysis (APD) Patients on APD typically perform 3-5 cycles at night and up to 2 cycles during the day. After the last outflow during the night_ the equipment is then disconnected from the patient and the dialysate remains in the peritoneum until the next cycle.

Fibroid Tumors of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy. Malformations of the reproductive organs incompatible with pregnancy. Pregnancy (see Use in Pregnancy & Lactation). Risk factors of OHSS: A history of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS); A previous COS cycle that resulted in more than 30 follicles > or = 11 mm measured by ultrasound examination; A basal antral follicle count > 20; Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).,Common Gastrointestinal: Nausea (2.3% ) Musculoskeletal: Discomfort_ In pelvis (6% )_ Pain in pelvis (2.9% ) Neurologic: Headache (4% ) Reproductive: Breast tenderness (1.3% ) Other: Fatigue (1.5% ) Serious Reproductive: Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (4.3% )_ Torsion of ovary (0.1% to less than 1% ),2-8_____,In the treatment of women of reproductive age_ the dose of Elonva is based on weight and age. A single 100-microgram dose is recommended in women who weigh less than or equal to 60 kilograms and who are 36 years of age or younger. A single 150-microgram dose is recommended in women: who weigh more than 60 kilograms_ regardless of age; who weigh 50 kilograms or more and who are older than 36 years of age. Women older than 36 years of age who weighed less than 50 kilograms were not studied. The recommended doses of Elonva have only been established in a treatment cycle with a GnRH antagonist that was administered from stimulation day 5 or day 6 onwards. Stimulation day 1: Elonva should be administered as a single subcutaneous injection_ preferably in the abdominal wall_ during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Stimulation day 5 or 6: Treatment with a Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) antagonist should be started on stimulation day 5 or day 6 depending on the ovarian response_ i.e. the number and size of growing follicles. The concurrent determination of serum estradiol levels may also be useful. The GnRH antagonist is used to prevent premature Luteinizing Hormone (LH) surges. Stimulation day 8: Seven days after the injection with Elonva on stimulation day 1_ COS treatment may be continued with daily injections of (recombinant) Follicle Stimulating Hormone ((rec)FSH) until the criterion for triggering final oocyte maturation (3 follicles > or = 17 mm) has been reached. The daily dose of (rec)FSH may depend on the ovarian response_ which should be monitored by regular ultrasonographic assessments from stimulation day 5 or 6 onwards. In normal responders a daily dose of 150 IU (rec)FSH is advised. Administration of (rec)FSH on the day of human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) administration can be omitted_ depending on the ovarian response. In general_ adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the ninth day of treatment (range 6 to 18 days). As soon as three follicles > or = 17 mm are observed_ a single injection of 5_000 up to 10_000 IU urinary hCG is administered the same day or the day thereafter to induce final oocyte maturation. In case of an excessive ovarian response_ see the recommendations given in Precautions in order to reduce the risk for developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).,______,,______,____,Uknown ____,[__] Elonva__________ ____________Elonva____________________________ ______________________,Unknown ____,[__] ____________Elonva_,SC;,,,,,_______(2°C-8°C)_________________25°C_(_)___________1___ _____

The rate of administration should not exceed 2 mL per minute_ as more rapid infusion may precipitate circulatory overload and pulmonary edema. The infusion of “TBSF” (20%) Human Albumin Solution is not justified in hypoproteinaemic states associated with chronic cirrhosis_ malabsorption_ protein-losing enteropathies_ pancreatic insufficiency_ or undernutrition. Shock The dose should be determined by the patient’s condition and response to treatment. The usual initial dose of 20 g human albumin (100 mL of “TBSF” (20%) Human Albumin Solution) may be administered as a blood volume expander at a rate of 2 to 4 mL per minute. The rate of infusion may be increased in emergencies and repeated in 15 to 30 minutes if necessary. The total dose should not exceed the level of albumin found in the normal individual i.e. about 2 g per kg body weight in the absence of active bleeding. If concentrated albumin (>4–5%) is given_ it should be accompanied by the intravenous infusion of a crystalloid solution. Failure to supply this additional fluid may lead to dehydration of the tissues. The precise nature and strength of the crystalloid solution will depend on the requirements of the patient for electrolytes and fluid. Burns The usual dose is 20-80 g human albumin (100-400 mL of “TBSF” (20%) Human Albumin Solution) given daily at the rate of about 1 mL per minute. Beyond 24 hours_ “TBSF” (20%) Human Albumin Solution can be used to maintain plasma colloid osmotic pressure. A reasonable goal is the maintenance of a plasma albumin concentration of 25 g/L or a colloid osmotic pressure of 20 mmHg. The continuing need for albumin is occasioned by losses from denuded areas and decreased albumin synthesis.,______,,______,____,Uknown ____,[__]___“______”(20%)____________________ ____________________________ _______“______”(20%)_________________________ _________________,Unknown ____,[__]____________ “______”(20%)_________________ ___________,IVD;,,_D5W___ __N/S___ _,,______(20%)_________________________(4~5%___)_____1mL______(20%)__________4mL__________________ _____ ___________<2mL/__ __(__________)_2-4mL/__ ___1mL/__,1.____________________________________ 2.________________________ 3.____________________________ 4.______________
